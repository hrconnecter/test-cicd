// // SkillLookup >
// //  Search box for search skills , filter by City  ,filter by Mgr ,filter by dept ,filter by  rating , filter by ovrallRating/Avg Rating
// // ex: if we search skill  as "HTML"> then  show how much(count) people have"hTML" skill 

// // ,if we add filter as "city" then show how much(count) people have "HTML" skill in "city" ,if we add filter as "mgr" then show how much(count) people have "HTML" skill under "mgr" ,if we add filter as "dept" then show how much(count) people have "HTML" skill under "dept" ,if we add filter as "rating" then show how much(count) people have "HTML" skill under "rating" ,if we add filter as "ovrallRating" then show how much(count) people have "HTML" skill under "ovrallRating" ,if we add filter as "avgRating" then show how much(count) people have "HTML" skill under "avgRating".. 

// // visevrsa if we  not search any Skill , and only filter by any one of above then show how much(count) people have "HTML" skill under "city" or "mgr" or "dept" or "rating" or "ovrallRating" or "avgRating"..




// // visevrsa if we  not search any Skill , and directly apply any of filter ex: city and select skill from dropwown (ex:nagpur), then show all skills> how much(count) skills employee under city  (html 50 perople , css 10 people ) ..similar for all  rest of filters


// // FE:table view or Graph View (this frontend should be dynamic,base on filters,search results ) 



// To implement the "SkillLookup" feature, here's a detailed breakdown of how to structure the application with the necessary front-end and back-end logic. The feature will allow dynamic searching and filtering of employees based on specific attributes like skills, city, manager, department, ratings, and more. I'll also include suggestions for the table and graph views.

// 1. Frontend Structure
// The frontend will need to handle dynamic search inputs and filters, and display results in both table and graph views. Here's the structure:

// Components:
// Search Box: For searching by skill.
// Filter Options: For filtering by:
// City (dropdown or autocomplete).
// Manager (dropdown or autocomplete).
// Department (dropdown or autocomplete).
// Rating (numeric filter or range slider).
// Overall Rating (numeric filter or range slider).
// Average Rating (numeric filter or range slider).
// Dynamic Table View: Displays filtered or searched results.
// Dynamic Graph View: Visualizes the filtered data (e.g., bar or pie charts).
// Front-end Workflow:
// Initial State:

// When the page loads, show all employees with their skills, and default filters can be shown (e.g., no search term, no filters applied).
// Search for Skill:

// When a user types a skill (e.g., "HTML") into the search box, show the number of people who have that skill.
// If the user enters a skill and applies filters, update the count dynamically based on the filters (e.g., how much(count) people have "HTML" skill in a certain city or department).
// Apply Filters:

// When filters are selected (e.g., city = "Nagpur"), the results should dynamically update to show how much(count) people have the selected skill in the chosen city, manager, or department.
// View Results:

// Table View: Shows detailed employee information in rows (e.g., Name, Skill, City, Department, Manager, Ratings).
// Graph View: Visualize the data, for example:
// Bar chart for the number of people with each skill per city.
// Pie chart for the distribution of overall ratings.
// Clear Filters/Reset Search: Allow users to reset filters or the search term to show all data.

// Example UI Design:
// Search Box: A text input to search skills (e.g., "HTML").
// Filter Sections:
// Dropdowns for City, Manager, Department.
// Range sliders for Rating, Overall Rating, and Average Rating.
// Results Section:
// A table that updates based on selected filters.
// A toggle between table and graph views.



// // Sure! Here's a quick guide and prompt to help you understand the entire process of building the Skill Lookup feature using MongoDB, Express, Node.js, and React.js. This will give you an overview of the flow, and when you're ready, I can assist with the actual implementation.

// // Quick Guide for Skill Lookup System
// // 1. Overview of the System
// // The Skill Lookup System will allow you to:

// // Search skills based on how much(count) people have this skills(count) (e.g., HTML =20 employee, JavaScript =2 employee etc.).
// // Apply filters to narrow down the search (city, department, manager, rating, number of skills).
// // Dynamically return the count of employees with the selected skill based on the applied filters.
// // 2. Tech Stack Overview
// // MongoDB: Database to store employee data and associated skills.
// // Express.js: Backend framework to handle API requests.
// // Node.js: Backend runtime environment for server-side logic.
// // React.js: Frontend framework to build the user interface.
// // 3. System Flow & Components
// // Frontend (React.js):
// // Skill Search & Filters UI:

// // Search Bar: Input for searching a skill (e.g., HTML, JavaScript).
// // Filters: Additional inputs to filter the results based on:
// // City (e.g., Nagpur, Mumbai).
// // Manager (e.g., John Doe).
// // Department (e.g., Engineering, Marketing).
// // Rating (e.g., 4 and above).
// // Min/Max Skills (e.g., filter employees with 2-5 skills).
// // Display Results:

// // Display the count of employees who match the selected skill and filters.
// // Optionally, show a graph to visualize the data (like a bar chart).

// // API Route:

// // The GET request will accept various query parameters (skill, city, manager, department, rating, minSkills, maxSkills).
// // The backend will query the MongoDB database to count the number of employees that match the filters.
// // MongoDB Query:

// // Use aggregate queries in MongoDB to count employees based on dynamic filters.
// // Use $match, $project, and $group to filter by skill, city, manager, and count the number of skills.
// // Response:

// // Return the count of employees matching the filters and the selected skill.




// Frontend:
// User Input:
// User enters a skill in the search bar (e.g., "HTML").
// User optionally applies filters for city, manager, department, rating, and min/max skills.
// API Call:
// On clicking Search, the frontend sends a GET request to the backend with the selected filters and skill.
// Display Results:
// The backend returns the count of employees.
// The frontend displays the count dynamically in a table or graph format.
